# Creating NoSQL with Apache Cassandra

In this project I create a Cassadra database to focus on speed of NoSQL table.

## Step 0
Install the nessary packes:
- cassandra
- pandas
- numpy

## Step 1
In order to run this program you must first run `python create_cassandra_tables.py`

This will drop and create the nessary table for the Cassadra database named **sparkify**.

## Step 2
Once the tables have been successfully created run the `insert_into_sparkify_db.ipynb` file.
Run each step sequenctially in order ot insert data into the tables.
